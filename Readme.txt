Project Name

Project Description: This project focuses on the analysis and transformation of bank transaction data. The primary objectives are data extraction, cleansing, and transformation, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Data Sources

Bank Transaction Data: The raw data was obtained from a financial institution, comprising columns such as 'Account No,' 'DATE,' 'TRANSACTION DETAILS,' 'CHQ.NO.,' 'VALUE DATE,' 'WITHDRAWAL AMT,' 'DEPOSIT AMT,' and 'BALANCE AMT.'

Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, removing extraneous characters from 'Account No,' and converting data types.
Rows with missing or inconsistent data were addressed.
Anomalies, such as negative withdrawal amounts, were identified and resolved.

Data Transformation

New columns were created, such as 'Total Amount,' to aggregate deposit and withdrawal data.
Derived features included calculating 'Monthly Average Deposit' and 'Transaction Count.'
Data aggregation was performed to summarize account-level information.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA revealed insights, including the distribution of deposit amounts, correlations between transaction attributes, and patterns over time.
Usage

Detailed code examples for data loading, cleaning, transformation, and EDA can be found in the project's Jupyter Notebook.
